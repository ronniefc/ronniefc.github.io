 Currently an Economics student @ Clemson University interning with the [Hamilton Project](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/){:target="\_blank"} at [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

Driven by promoting human dignity in public assistance and economic development. Hoping to figure out what 'Activist Researcher' means and willing to nerd out over regression analysis and policy evaluation. Check out other stuff I do for 'work' [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronnie-clevenstine-47021b176/){:target="\_blank"}. When I'm not working, you might find me on tiny van adventures, reading, or going on long walks with other people's dogs.

If you want to chat about anything dignity or dogs related, find me [here](mailto:vcleven@clemson.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
