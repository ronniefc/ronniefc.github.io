 I'm currently an Economics student @ Clemson University, intending to graduate May 2022. This summer, I will be spending most of my time as an Economics Intern with the [Hamilton Project](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/){:target="\_blank"} at [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm driven by promoting human dignity in public assistance and economic development. I'm working towards figuring out what 'Activist Researcher' means and how to become one. More than willing to nerd out over regression analysis and policy evaluation with anyone. Check out other stuff I do for 'work' [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronnie-clevenstine-47021b176/){:target="\_blank"}. When I'm not working, you might find me on tiny van adventures, reading, or going on long walks with other people's dogs.

If you want to chat about dignity, dogs, development, or otherwise, find me [here](mailto:vcleven@clemson.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
